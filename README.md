# 🎓 Token-Based Learning Rewards in Education

## 📘 Project Description
This smart contract implements a token-based reward system to incentivize learning and educational engagement.

- Cross-institution reward tracking and interoperability using NFTs or Soulbound Tokens.
- Adding staking mechanisms for long-term educational goals.
